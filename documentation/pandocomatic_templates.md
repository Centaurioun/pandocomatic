## Pandocomatic templates {#pandocomatic-templates}

Note that the pandocomatic YAML property is named `pandocomatic_`. Pandoc has
the [convention](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#metadata-blocks) that YAML
property names ending with an underscore will be ignored by pandoc and can be
used by programs like pandocomatic. Pandocomatic adheres to this convention.
However, for backwards compatibility the property name `pandocomatic` still
works, it just will not be ignored by pandoc.
