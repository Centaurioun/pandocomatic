## Installation

Pandocomatic is a [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) program and can be
installed through [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) as follows:

~~~{.bash}
gem install pandocomatic
~~~

This will install pandocomatic and
[paru](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/paru/), a Ruby wrapper around
pandoc. To use pandocomatic, you also need a working pandoc installation. See
[pandoc's installation guide](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for more
information about installing pandoc.

You can also download the latest gem,
[pandocomatic-::pandocomatic::version](https://github.com/htdebeer/pandocomatic/blob/master/releases/pandocomatic-::pandocomatic::version.gem),
from Github and install it manually as follows:

~~~{.bash}
cd /directory/you/downloaded/the/gem/to
gem install pandocomatic-::pandocomatic::version.gem
~~~
